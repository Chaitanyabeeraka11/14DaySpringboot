### What the Method Does

The `getBookById` method is designed to find a book with a specific ID from a list of books.

### Breaking It Down

#### Method Signature

```java
public Optional<Book> getBookById(Long id)
```

- `public`: This means that the method can be accessed from outside the class.
- `Optional<Book>`: The method returns an `Optional<Book>`. This means that it may or may not return a `Book` object. If the book is found, it returns the book. If not, it returns an empty result.
- `getBookById(Long id)`: The method's name is `getBookById`, and it takes one parameter: `Long id`. This is the ID of the book we are looking for.

#### Method Body

```java
return books.stream().filter(book -> book.getId().equals(id)).findFirst();
```

- `books.stream()`: This converts the list of books into a stream. Think of a stream as a way to look at each item in the list one by one.
- `filter(book -> book.getId().equals(id))`: This part filters the stream. It checks each book in the stream to see if its ID matches the ID we are looking for.
  - `book -> book.getId().equals(id)`: This is a lambda expression. It's like saying, "For each book, check if the book's ID is equal to the ID we are looking for."
- `findFirst()`: This method returns the first book that matches the filter criteria. If no books match, it returns an empty `Optional`.

### Example

Imagine you have a list of books:

- Book 1: ID = 1, Title = "Spring Boot in Action"
- Book 2: ID = 2, Title = "Spring Boot in Practice"

If you call `getBookById(2L)`, the method will:
1. Convert the list of books into a stream.
2. Filter the stream to find books with ID 2.
3. Find the first book that matches the ID (in this case, Book 2).

If the book is found, it returns an `Optional` containing Book 2. If not, it returns an empty `Optional`.

### Putting It All Together

So, in simple terms, the `getBookById` method takes an ID, looks through the list of books to find a book with that ID, and returns it if found. If no book with the given ID is found, it returns an empty result.
